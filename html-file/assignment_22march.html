                    <p><img src="../images/pin.png" /> Descendant selectors</p>
                    <p>The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single
                     space ( ) character — combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector 
                     are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector. Selectors that 
                     utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
                     The descendant combinator is technically one or more CSS white space characters — 
                     the space character and/or one of four control characters: carriage return, form 
                     feed, new line, and tab characters — between two selectors in the absence of 
                     another combinator. Additionally, the white space characters of which the combinator 
                     is comprised may contain any number of CSS comments.
                     The abstract nature of this combinator makes it different from the other standardized 
                     combinators as these combinators are all represented by a distinct, finite character 
                     sequence. This inconsistency was addressed with the addition of a redundant descendant 
                     combinator represented by two greater‐than characters in sequence (>>), giving it a form 
                     that is particularly similar to the child combinator, which shares a similar function.
